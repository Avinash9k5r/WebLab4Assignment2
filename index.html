    <h1>Version Control System</h1>
    <p>
      In software engineering, version control (also known as revision control, source control, or source code management) is a class of systems responsible for managing changes to computer programs, documents, large web sites, or other collections of information. Version control is a component of software configuration management.
<br>
Changes are usually identified by a number or letter code, termed the "revision number", "revision level", or simply "revision". For example, an initial set of files is "revision 1". When the first change is made, the resulting set is "revision 2", and so on. Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the person making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged.

    <h1>Git and GitHub</h1>
    <p>
      Simply put, Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service that lets you manage Git repositories. If you have open-source projects that use Git, then GitHub is designed to help you better manage them.

    <h2>Git Commands</h2>
    <hr>
    <p><b>git init <br></b>
This command turns a directory into an empty Git repository. This is the first step in creating a repository. After running git init, adding and committing files/directories is possible.
<br>
<div class="usage">
  <i>Usage:</i><br># change directory to codebase<br>
  $ cd /file/path/to/code<br>
  # make directory a git repository<br>
  $ git init
</div>


  <hr>
  <p><b>git add <br> </b>
Adds files in the to the staging area for Git. Before a file is available to commit to a repository, the file needs to be added to the Git index (staging area). There are a few different ways to use git add, by adding entire directories, specific files, or all unstaged files.
<br>

<div class="usage">
  <i>Usage:</i><br>
  $ git add 'file or directory name'
</div>
<hr>
<p><b>git commit<br></b>
Record the changes made to the files to a local repository. For easy reference, each commit has a unique ID.
<br>
It’s best practice to include a message with each commit explaining the changes made in a commit. Adding a commit message helps to find a particular change or understanding the changes.
<br>
<div class="usage">
  <i>Usage:</i><br>
  # Adding a commit with message<br>
$ git commit -m "Commit message in quotes"

</div>
<hr>
<p><b>git status</b><br>
  This command returns the current state of the repository.<br>

<i>git status</i> will return the current working branch. If a file is in the staging area, but not committed, it shows with git status. Or, if there are no changes it’ll return nothing to commit, working directory clean.
<br>
<div class="usage">
  <i>Usage:</i><br>
  $ git status

</div>
<hr>
<p><b>git push</b><br>
Sends local commits to the remote repository. <i>git push</i> requires two parameters: the remote repository and the branch that the push is for.
<br>
<div class="usage">
  <i>Usage:</i>
  $ git push 'remote_URL/remote_name' 'branch'<br>

# Push all local branches to remote repository<br>
$ git push —all
</div>
<hr>
